        My name is <strong>Biniyam Assefa</strong>, and I am a software engineer
        student at Addis Ababa University. I was born and raised in
        <em>Woldia</em>, a city in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Woldia is
        known for its cultural and religious festivals, such as the
        <strong>Ashenda</strong> and the <strong>Timket</strong>. I grew up in a
        loving family with my parents and three sisters. My father,<strong>
          Assefa Mkonen</strong
        >, is a teacher at a local school, and my mother,
        <strong>Sisaynesh Asgidome</strong>, is a nurse at a nearby hospital. My
        sisters are <em>Burtkan Assefa, Eredet Assefa, and Mahlet Assefa</em>.
        They are all younger than me, and they are studying at different levels
        of education. I love my family very much, and I always try to keep in
        touch with them. I moved to Addis Ababa after I finished high school,
        and I enrolled in the software engineering program at the university. I
        have always been interested in computers and technology, and I want to
        pursue a career in this field. I enjoy learning new skills and solving
        problems with code. I also like to make friends and participate in
        extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, and clubs. I am proud
        of my achievements so far, and I hope to accomplish more in the future.
