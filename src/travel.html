        <h1 class="p-6 text-center uppercase">place that i visitd</h1>
        <h5 class="p-6 text-center uppercase">The first place I visited is Lalibela</h5>
        <p>
          I have always wanted to visit Lalibela and i did , the holy city of
          Ethiopia, where the ancient rock-hewn churches stand as a testament to
          the faith and devotion of the people. I was amazed by the
          architectural and artistic wonders that were carved out of solid stone
          more than 800 years ago. I felt a sense of awe and reverence as I
          walked through the narrow passages and tunnels that connected the 11
          churches, each with its own unique style and decoration. I admired the
          intricate carvings and paintings that adorned the walls and ceilings,
          depicting scenes from the Bible and the lives of the saints. I joined
          the pilgrims and worshippers who came from all over the country to
          pray and sing in the sacred spaces. I was moved by the spiritual
          atmosphere and the beauty of the place. Lalibela was more than just a
          tourist site, it was a living and breathing expression of the
          Ethiopian culture and history
        </p>
        <h5 class="p-6 text-center uppercase">The second place I visited is Dubai</h5>
        <p>
          Dubai was an amazing place to visit, and I had a wonderful time there.
          I was amazed by the beauty and the diversity of the city, which
          offered me a lot of fun and memorable experiences. I saw the
          magnificent skyscrapers, such as the Burj Khalifa, the tallest
          building in the world, and the Burj Al Arab, the only seven-star hotel
          in the world. I also visited the rich heritage and history of Dubai,
          such as the Bastakiya Quarter, where I learned about the old
          wind-tower houses and the Dubai Museum, where I discovered the past of
          the city. Dubai also had many exciting activities, such as skiing in
          the Mall of the Emirates, which had an indoor ski slope, or safari in
          the desert, where I rode a camel, watched the sunset, and enjoyed a
          traditional dinner. Dubai was a place where I experienced the best of
          both worlds, and that is why I loved it.

        the temples and tombs of Luxor, Aswan, and Abu Simbel. Luxor is home to
        the Karnak Temple, the largest religious complex ever built, and the
        Valley of the Kings, where the pharaohs were buried in elaborate tombs1.
